# numbersOfFive  
## A simple 5-number summary calculator built and developed by Jack Bashford

## Usage

To use Numbers Of Five, simply copy/paste your data into a file called "data.txt", then launch the program - it accepts numbers separated by whitespace (e.g. newlines or spaces).

It will then calculate the five-number summary of your given data - the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum, with the range, inter-quartile range, and any outliers also provided for ease.

(I can also provide features on-request; donations will speed up this process as I'm currently heavily invested in education).
